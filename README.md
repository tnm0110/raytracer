# raytracer
# This repository contains MATLAB scripts and functions to trace P-wave or S-wave rays given a 1D velocity model in both flat Earth and spherical Earth systems.
# Currently, the scripts use the AK135 velocity model by default. However, they can be easily modified to accept any 1D velocity model for ray tracing.
# The main function, raytracer_sph.m, is used to trace the rays and generate plots.
# Please feel free to contact me if you need any assistance.
